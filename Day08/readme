diff between replica controller and replica set.

Replica controller:-
    1. It will create the pods that is defined in YAML file only.
    2. It is old one.

Replica Sets:
    1. It has selector, it will create pods which is defined in YAMl file, Also it will take pods(existing pods) which has same label like (env=demo).So it will magaed the existing pods also.
    2. Currently people prefer replica sets as it has selector.
